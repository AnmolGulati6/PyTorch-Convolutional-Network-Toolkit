# PyTorch Convolutional Network Toolkit

## Overview
This toolkit is designed to facilitate the development and understanding of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using PyTorch. It includes custom implementations of foundational CNN components such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and batch normalization, along with a robust framework for constructing, training, and evaluating deep learning models.

## Features
- **Custom CNN Layers**: Implementations of convolutional layers, max pooling, and ReLU activations that allow for detailed manipulation and inspection of intermediate computations.
- **Utility Classes**: Helper classes for common tasks like model training, parameter initialization, and loss computation.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable architecture to experiment with different network configurations and training routines.
- **Example Models**: Pre-built models demonstrating how to use the toolkit to construct common CNN architectures like VGG and ResNet.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-github/convolutional-networks-pytorch.git
```
Navigate to the cloned directory, and if necessary, install required packages:
```
cd convolutional-networks-pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To start using the toolkit, import the necessary modules and create your network:
```python
from convolutional_networks import ThreeLayerConvNet, DeepConvNet
from training_utils import Solver

# Initialize a simple three-layer convolutional network
model = ThreeLayerConvNet(input_dims=(3, 32, 32), num_classes=10)
# Set up the solver
solver = Solver(model, data, optim_config={
  'learning_rate': 1e-3,
}, lr_decay=0.95)
# Train the model
solver.train()
```

## Customizing Your Network
You can easily customize the toolkit to explore different architectures. For example, you can modify `DeepConvNet` to change the number of layers, filter sizes, or include batch normalization.

## Contributing
Contributions to the toolkit are welcome. Please submit pull requests with your proposed changes.
